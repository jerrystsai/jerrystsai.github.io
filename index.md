## What does this app do?

+ The **Simple Algebra Practice** app allows you to practice solving a particular type of algebra problem: two equations with two unknowns
+ Example problem:
  + 3*x* + 2*y* = 12
  + 1*x* + -3*y* = -7
  + Solve for *x* and *y*

## Why should you use this app?

- Gain confidence with algebra through practice
- Designed so calculations can comfortably be done by hand
- The problem changes with each iteration, so you get a variety of practice problems

## How do I play this app?

1. Read the equations.
2. Solve for the unknowns: *x* and *y*.
3. Enter your proposed values for *x* and *y* in the input boxes.
4. Press the "Submit" button.
5. If your answers are correct, the app will tell you. If not, you'll get a second chance to solve.
