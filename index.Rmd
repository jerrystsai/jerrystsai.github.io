## What does this app do?

+ The **Simple Algebra Practice** app allows you to practice solving a particular type of algebra problem: two equations with two unknowns
+ Example problem: solve for $x$ and $y$
  + $3x + 2y = 12$
  + $1x + -3y = -7$
+ Solution to example:
```{r solution_to_above_equations}
## Solution to above example AND required embedded R code
det_mtx <- det(matrix(c(3,1,2,-3), nrow=2))
det_x <- det(matrix(c(12,-7,2,-3), nrow=2)); det_y <- det(matrix(c(3,1,12,-7), nrow=2))
paste0("x = ", det_x / det_mtx, " and y = ", det_y / det_mtx)
```

## Why should you use this app?

- Gain confidence with algebra through practice
- Designed so calculations can comfortably be done by hand
- The problem changes with each iteration, so you get a variety of practice problems

## How do I play this app?

1. Read the equations.
2. Solve for the unknowns: $x$ and $y$.
3. Enter your proposed values for $x$ and $y$ in the input boxes.
4. Press the "Submit" button.
5. If your answers are correct, the app will tell you. If not, you'll get a second chance to solve.
